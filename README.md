# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Description

Using Node.js and inquirer package, we are building a README.md file generator based on user input. I used the following guide to help build the  generator the accurate information: [Professional README] (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide). I couldn't get the license badge function to work at the moment, but a work in progress for sure.

Shoutout to this resource for the help on license badges: https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba
